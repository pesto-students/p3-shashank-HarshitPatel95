## _When a user enters an URL in the browser, how does the browser fetch the desired result ?_

# URLs

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is an address of website which we want to access. URL indicating resource on the internet like image, text, hypertext pages, audio files, video files etc.

URLs contain protocol, domain name, path name
URL Example : https://www.pesto.tech/become-a-developer

- Protocol :- https://
- Domain :- www.pesto.tech
- Path :- become-a-developer

> When a user enter an URL in web browserâ€™s address bar, the browser looks up the IP address for the domain name using DNS (Domain Name System). Browser initiates a connection with the server using Transfer Control Protocol. Browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. Server handles request and sends back response to the browser. Browser render the HTML and other resource to the users. Once page loaded, browser sends further requests which is initiate by users.
